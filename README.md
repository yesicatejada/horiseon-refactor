# Refactor Homework

Refactoring the existing code to make it more accessible.
## Description

This project was designed to help me practice refactoring websites. I did this by:
-Deleted Div elements in index.html
-Added spacing and comments for a better clarity to the code.
-Removed benefit-lead, benefit-brand, benefit-cost classes for h3 and revised h3 to affect all h3 element tags.
-Added semantic HTML elements.
-Added alt attribute to images.

## Functionality and accessibility
-This website has a functioning navigation bar that takes you to the correlation section on the page when you click it.
-The images have alternative text in case the image does not load properly on the web browser.
